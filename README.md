<h1 align="center">Basic Material Starter Kit</h1>

<p align="center">
    Basic template for your experiments and prototyping with <a href="https://material.io/develop/web" target="_blank">Material Components for the Web</a> (or MDC-Web)
</p>

The template is based on [Getting Started](https://material.io/develop/web/docs/getting-started) doc, but fixes some errors and adds small improvements:

- fixed outdated `babel-loader` configuration
- links `Roboto` font
- proper `mdc-button` HTML markup


The template uses MDC-Web with SASS (not via CDN) allowing you to use mixins, perform customizations and theming. As an example, the template includes and customizes [@material/button](https://material.io/components/buttons/web) component.


## Usage

Clone the repo, then:

``` bash
# install dependencies
